    <description>This activity pack contains long running activities that enables to build orchestration process by chaining various RPA workflows through Orchestrator Queues and Start Job, as well as inject human tasks during workflow execution.
This pack contains activities that persists the workflow context in a central persistence store so that workflows can wait for long running activities to complete without blocking resources (Robots and Human).

IMPORTANT: This package version requires Studio v2019.10 or above and Orchestrator v2020.2 or above. This also requires mandatory upgrade of UiPath.FormActivityLibrary to 1.0.2 or above. Installing it on versions lower than the recommended ones will not provide the long running workflow capabilities and may create un-expected results during execution.</description>
